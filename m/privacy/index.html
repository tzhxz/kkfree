    </header>

      If you are an individual in the European Union (EU), we collect and
      process data about you only where we have legal bases for doing so under
      applicable EU laws. This means we collect and process your data only when:
      It is necessary for a legitimate interest (which is not overridden by your
      individual privacy interests), such as preventing fraud, improving the
      Service, and increasing the security of the Service and network
      infrastructure; You have consented to this collection and processing for a
      specific purpose; It is necessary to fulfil our contractual obligations;
      or It is necessary to comply with a legal obligation. Where we rely on our
      legitimate interests to process your personal data, you have the right to
      object. More information on exercising this right can be found in section
      10 addressing Individual Rights. Some examples of our legitimate interests
      and the data being processed include: Network and information security (IP
      address, user/device ID) Customer Support and fraud prevention (email
      address) Improving our products and services (activity logs) Where we rely
      on your consent to process your personal data, you have the right to
      withdraw or decline consent at any time. If you wish to withdraw your

      <h2>10. Individual Rights</h2>
    </header>
    <p>
      kkfreegame makes certain choices available to you when it comes to your
      personal data. Please review the below information outlining your choices
      and how to exercise them. We will respond to all requests within a
      reasonable timeframe. If our full response will ever take more than a
      month due to complexity or scope, we will notify you of this and keep you
      updated. We may request more information to confirm your identity before
      acting on any request. Review and update your data: You have the right to
      access and update any personal data that we have collected. To review or
      update this data, please submit a request using the contact information at
      the end of this section. Delete your data: You also hold the right to have
      your personal data deleted. This is sometimes known as the ‘right to be
      forgotten’. To request that we delete all personal data about you, please
      submit a request using the contact information at the end of this section.
      After you delete your personal data from our services, we may not
      immediately delete residual copies from our active servers and may not
      immediately remove data from our backup systems for archiving, prevention
      of fraud and abuse, analytics, satisfaction of legal obligations, or where
      we otherwise reasonably believe that we have a legitimate reason to do so.
      We may also decline to honor this request in certain specific situations,
      such as if the data is necessary to comply with a legal obligation or to
      exercise/defend a legal claim. Restrict Processing: You have the right to
      restrict how we process your personal data in certain circumstances. This
      is an alternative to requesting the deletion of your data. Rather than
      requesting we delete all of your personal data, you may request that we
      limit our uses of your personal data to specific purposes. You may wish to
      request we restrict our processing if you contest the accuracy of your
      personal data and we are working to verify this information, or if you
      want us to retain your personal data in connection to a legal claim but
      cease processing it. Data Portability: You have the right to obtain copies
      of your information in a structured, commonly used format that you can
      move your data between our service and the services of others. We may
      request more information to confirm your identity before providing any
      personal data. Right to Object: You have the right to object to the
      processing of your personal data for direct marketing purposes or when our
      processing of your data is based on legitimate interests. You may request
      that we stop processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes.
      This is an absolute right and we cannot refuse this request. Beyond direct
      marketing, if you wish to exercise this right, you must give specific
      reasons why you object to our processing of your data, based on your
      particular situation. Even after receiving such a request, we may continue
      processing if it is necessary for the exercise/defense of a legal claim or
      if we can demonstrate a compelling legitimate ground for the processing.
      If any request made under this section is clearly unfounded or excessive,
      we may reject the request or require a reasonable fee to honor the
      request. If we decide to reject your request, we will inform you of the
      reasons for not taking action and provide information on other possible
      remedies. If we decide that a reasonable fee is necessary, we will
      promptly inform you and will comply with the request upon receipt of this
      fee.
