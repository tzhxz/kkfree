      against you all of your applicable representations, warranties, covenants,
      indemnifications and obligations under these Terms of Use. If any part of
      these Terms of Use is unenforceable (including, without limitation, any
      part of the binding arbitration provision above), the unenforceable part
      shall be construed to reflect, as nearly as possible, the original
      intentions of the parties. The other provisions of these Terms of Use
      shall remain in full force and effect. The terms related to protection of
      the Company’s intellectual property rights, disclaimer of warranties
      limitation of liability, choice of law and binding arbitration,
      indemnification obligations and any licenses granted by you to the Company
      shall survive any termination of these Terms of Use. The Company’s failure
      to insist upon or enforce strict performance of any provision of these
      Terms of Use shall not constitute a waiver of the provision. Neither a
      course of dealing or conduct between you and the Company nor any trade
      practices shall be deemed to modify these Terms of Use.
